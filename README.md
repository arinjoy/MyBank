# MyBank
An app made with ‚ù§Ô∏è to demonstrate some examples of **clean architecture**, **code organisation**, **loose coupling**, **unit testing** and some of the best practices used in modern iOS programming using `Swift`.

### App Goal:
 - Show account details after fetching from network
 - Load a list of transactions grouped by dates under the account details
 - Transactions are divided as cleared and penning but they show together in correct order grouped by dates to show transactions of the same day under one section
 - Pull to refresh the view to load latest data and show a loading indicator
 - Show error alerts when there in an issue
 - Make sure all devices and orientations are supported (use size class)
 - Some of the transactions are ATM based and they show location icon and tapping those transactions navigate to the ATM location page on a map view
 - Add support for iOS 13 **Dark mode** 
 
The data for the `account details + transaction history + atm locations` are all combined together and comes from the this json file hosted in dropbox.

Refer to the following lines 50 and 51 in `AccountDetailsViewController.swift` to make change between local/remote data.

```
// var networkService = ServicesProvider.defaultProvider().network
var networkService = ServicesProvider.localStubbedProvider().network
```

The code also pulls this data locally from a JSON file if needed and used for testing, debugging purposes, Particularly XCUITest picks the data from a local stubbed JSON file.

### Installation
 - Xcode 11.6+ (required)
 - Clean /DerivedData folder if any
 - Build the project and let the Swift Package Manager pulls two remote libraries used
for unit testing ‚Äì `Quick` & `Nimble`
![](/Screenshots/screenshot-4.png "")

### 3rd Party Libraries (only in unit testing)
 - `Quick` - To unit test as much as possible ü§´
 - `Nimble` - To pair with Quick üë¨

### Apple frameworks
 `Combine` ‚Äì To do reactive binding when needed ü§´
 `UIKit` ‚Äì To build as usual everywhere üòÄ
 `SwiftUI` - To design/build UI fast (only for the ATM map view ) üôà
 
 ### Clean Architecture
 - **VIPER** ‚Äì To get as much loose coupling as possible
 - Clean communication between `Display`, `Presenter` and `Router` in the view/scene
stack
 - Communication between `Interactor`, `Service` in the lower stacks of domain &
network layers
 - Connectivity of this components are achieved via protocol instances to achieve loose coupling and unit testability
 - View (i.e. View Controller) is Display itself and contacts its Presenter
 - Presenter may perform view related logic and immediately talk back to Display (for
example, talking to interactor to fetch data from somewhere)
           
 - Presenter can communicate with underlying Interactor layer for more complex task
 - Interactor decides all Domain level business logic to take care of
 - Interactor communicates with underlying Network Service layer via abstracted
service provider which picks the one that is needed (i.e. real network vs. local stub)
 - Service implementation communicates to its underlying http client abstracted
via `Resource` which handles all networking (stubbed version reads from local
JSON)
 - Interactor gets back information via reactive binding from Service
 - Interactor parses the data and apply any necessary data transformation
 - Interactor gives outcome back to Presenter via reactive (AnyPublisher in
Combine)
 - Presenter handles all the presentation related logic necessary for the view
 - Presenter talks back to Display
 - Presenter also talks to Router to navigate from one scene to another when needed
 

### Code Organisation / Layers / Grouping
Folder / Grouping are done as per below:
Project has 3 targets: 
 - MyBank - The main code
 - MyBankTest - Unit testing of all layers using Quick/Nimble
 - MyBankUITest - Some automated XCUITest

### Business Logic
The core business logic of handling the transactions, and grouping the into dates, combining cleared & pending transactions together are done inside the interactor.
The low level JSON parsed data models are getting mapped as [TransactionGroup] and it has its own TransactionModel object that has extra properties and info needed by the presentation layer.
These domain level models get mapped into presentation level models at presentation layer. There are transformers which does the job to create presentation items needed exactly for the UI rendering, such as date formatting, currency formatting, or even bold text injection of ‚ÄúPENDING:‚Äù via NSAttributedString. They also inject custom accessibility elements such as combined labels needed for the UI.

### Unit Testing
 - Data Layer logic (fully tested)
 - Domain Layer logic (fully tested)
 - Presentation layer logic including presenter, display, router communication and transformers are tested individually
 
### Accessibility
 - Custom accessibility to each element is supported
 - They are computed via transformers which are also unit tested

### Custom Error Handling
- The network layer implementation handles most of the known HTTP error codes
-  More assumptions can be made in future based server returned code
- All errors fallback to show as generic error on the UI
- Network offline error shows differently with another message
- Presenter logic makes decision on how to handle what error (unit tested)
- There is also a loading indicator on the top and Pull to refresh is also supported

### Custom Theme
 - All font & colours are used from a central Theme provider
 - Colors have dark mode support
 - Dynamic scaling of the fonts are supported

### Use of SwiftUI (experimental feature on map)
- A custom SwiftUI view is made for the ATM map
- This follows the coordinator pattern to talk to MapKit delegate
- A custom pin image has been attached to the annotation
- The code is kept very simple and not unit tested
